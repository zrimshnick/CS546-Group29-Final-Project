Tracklete
This website acts as a tool for athletes to organize their training plan and progress to make sure that they are on a path that best helps for development. Users will have their own profiles in which they can create a type of workout to be tracked and a measurement value for progress. The user can title their exercise/workout in any way they want allowing for a variety of workouts to be entered in. Users can view their workouts in a table that organizes their data for each workout to see their progress.
